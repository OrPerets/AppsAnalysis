# AppsAnalysis
A data analysis project for mobile applications and its uses
Based on the CRISP-DM methodology

** Add Lotan's part ( Ask for in which phase to add it ) **
** Ask Or - in which phase to add the design? **

## Business understanding:
What is the probability of an application in the google playstore to achieve success considering different varients.

## Data understanding:
Selecting relevant data from various datasources containing data of the apps in the google playstore

## Data preparation:
Using star scheme design in order to decide which data to explore

## Modeling:
### supervised learning in order to predict the success rate of an app based on price and rating.
  Depending on the type of the test group, we used one of the following algorithms:
  
  Continuous variable:

  1. Random forest regressor
  2. Linear rgression

  Discreet variable:

  3. Random forest classifier
  4. KNeighborsClassifier
  5. SVM classifier 

### unsupervised learning algorithms in order to predict the success rate of an app 

## Evaluation:
** Conclusions?

<!-- ## Phase 1:
Choose a dataset and a research question
Decide on a design for the project

## Phase 2: ETL ( Only E and T)
E - Extracting all of the available data sources
T - Transform - map all datasources to our design and fill the tables + create a software design
 
## Phase 3:
Formalize design

## Phase 4:
Exploration - Exploring tables (App, Installs, Rating, Reviews)

## Phase 5:
Standardization of each table

## Phase 6:
Queries - Joined tables ( Apps & Installs, Apps & Rating, Apps & Reviews)
- results and conclusions based on the queries

## Phase 7:
Feature importance for each of the joined tables while using random forest regressor algorithm -->
